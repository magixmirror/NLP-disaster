# NLP Disaster Tweets 

This repository presents a deep learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
To build this model, we should prepared the data to be suitable for the model to give the best possible results. 
In this notebook, we used the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning which considers type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning model.

In this repository, we used the Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets dataset. [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started]
